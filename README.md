# Gesture-controlled-Crocodile-Game
This is a fun arcade-style game where a cartoon crocodile moves left and right at the bottom of the screen, avoiding falling obstacles (red boxes) from the top. The game is controlled using real-time hand gestures captured via webcam using OpenCV and MediaPipe and the Game engine via pygame.
